# Virtual Pets
## Run
### AMOK!!!!

In this game, you will be volunteering at AMOK Shelter, where the dogs & cats are both organic and robotic.

There is only ONE litter box for the organic cats to share. That needs to be cleaned OFTEN.

The organic dogs are all in cages - those need to be cleaned often as well.

Both the organic and robotic dogs need to be walked.

You have the option to play with an individual pet (and there are options!)
- fetch
- obstacle course
- red laser pointer
- teach a new trick

You can adopt from the shelter.

You can surrender an organic dog or cat, or robotic dog or cat to the shelter.

If you catch on to the theme of the names, there are some hidden gems in there. Hope you find them :P
